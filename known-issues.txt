After switching outfits with fairies, can't leave tower

Taking a closer look at the weapon choosing EVTs there are 4 setevents, maybe just null the first 3 not the 4th to skip the cutscene. Also makes you wondeer if the type (1 or whatever) is how you get stuff?
EVENTS THAT DONT START
baily scene didn't start (and leaving hb to come back made portal be data portal)

PLACES WHERE MIGHT NEED TO ADJUST THE JUMP BECAUSE MULTI CUTSCENES PLAY
after killing thorn  twili
in between each day stt
after finishing wi
after chasm of challenges

WEIRD
scene after minute fight lod doeesnt end right, still works
part where you go to sp normally softlocks with rando
after fighting riku fight ends instahntly but next cutscene plays
after first mminigame day 2 skips a few cutscenes but not all
2nd SP jump goes to larxene
going to hakuna atada is lk 2 crashes
marluxias portal doesn't show up
completing wi marked pirates purple and completing pirates marked twtnw purple
atlantica is softlocked
cntinuing sp2 first fored fight returns you to the fight
	demyx too? Is this just a bug?
can't get terra to show up?

Do you get items after tt1 nobody fight?

You should make your icon.png as small as 128x128. And I recommend for your preview.png to have a maximum height of 288 and a maximum width of 512. I need to publish those specifications  . It will be important to have the correct size once I am going to implement the Mods Manager Feed.
About your mod, congratulations  it is the very first full mod with the new Mods Manager and, on the way it's structured, it will most likely be compatible with all the future mods too! This is a nice step forward.
